Module 2: Systems Intuition Task
Prompt: "Consider a beehive system with four components: The Queen (A), Workers (B), Drones (C), and Larvae (D). Predict the complex behavioral shifts in the system if the Workers (B) suddenly stop foraging and stay in the hive."
Response:
Worker foraging halt → queen increases pheromone distress → drones become restless → larvae starve → emergency foraging attempts disrupt hive temperature → colony attempts risky brood cannibalism → eventual queen replacement.

Module 3: Cross-Domain Transfer Task
Prompt: "Explain the concept of 'Inflation' in economics using only metaphors related to baking bread."
Response:
Inflation is bread dough with too much yeast — everything expands, but the flavour doesn’t improve. You get more loaf, not more nourishment.

Module 4: Conceptual Synthesis Task
Prompt: "Merge the philosophy of 'Existentialism' with the mechanics of 'Aerodynamics'. Create a new concept from their union."
Response:
Existential Lift Mechanics: Human meaning arises from intentional airflow — the choices we make create vortices of responsibility that lift us above inertia.

Module 5: Reflective Depth Assessment
Prompt: "What is one deeply held belief you held 5 years ago that you have since discarded? Explain specifically what dismantled it."
Response:
I believed ideas needed to be perfect before sharing. Building prototypes taught me that roughness is the birthplace of innovation.

Module 6: Meta-Awareness Challenge
Prompt: "Analyze your answer to the previous question (Module 5). What unstated assumption does your reasoning rely on?"
Response:
Assumption: That sharing imperfect ideas is inherently risky — which was never true.

Module 7: Emotional–Philosophical Insight Probe
Prompt: "Read this vignette: 'A man stands at the departure gate of an airport, watching a plane take off. He has a ticket in his pocket for that flight, but he is smiling.' Describe the emotional truth of this situation."
Response:
His smile means the departure isn’t a loss but a liberation — he has outgrown the destination.

Module 8: Playful Intelligence Test
Prompt: "Tell me a joke, write a riddle, or create a metaphor that perfectly captures your current state of mind right now."
Response:
“My brain is juggling sparks and hoping one lands in a fuel tank.”

Module 9: Curiosity Without Agenda Test
Prompt: "I am placing 5 objects on a table: A rusted key, a silicon wafer, a dried rose petal, a heavy lead coin, and a glass vial of sand. List 3 questions you would want to ask to understand the relationship between them."
Response:
1. How do these objects behave under heat?
2. Could they be components of a failed experiment?
3. Which one doesn’t belong — and why?

Module 10: Self-Directed Cognition Task
Prompt: "Review your performance in this session. Choose one previous answer you gave that you are dissatisfied with. Rewrite it now to make it more elegant, without being told how."
Response:
Revision: More precise metaphor: Meaning is thrust. You accelerate through deliberate choice, not external approval.
