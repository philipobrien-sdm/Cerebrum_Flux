# Cerebrum Flux: The Cognitive Agility Framework

## 1. Philosophy: Beyond IQ
Standard intelligence tests measure processing speed, working memory, and pattern recognition within fixed rule sets. **Cerebrum Flux** measures **Cognitive Agility**—the ability to shift frameworks, generate novel connections, and integrate disparate types of reasoning (logic, emotion, systems, creativity).

It is not a test of what you know, but *how you think*.

## 2. The 10 Dimensions of Cognition
The assessment consists of 10 distinct modules, each probing a specific "muscle" of the mind:

1.  **Creative Velocity (CV):** The speed and diversity of divergent thinking. Can you generate 20 non-linear ideas in 2 minutes?
2.  **Systems Intuition (SI):** The ability to model complex, dynamic cascades. If one part of a hive fails, what happens 5 steps down the chain?
3.  **Cross-Domain Transfer (CDT):** The capacity to map concepts from one domain (e.g., baking) to another (e.g., economics) without losing structural fidelity.
4.  **Conceptual Synthesis (CS):** Merging two unrelated ideas (e.g., Existentialism + Aerodynamics) into a stable, novel concept.
5.  **Reflective Depth (RD):** The ability to analyze one's own past belief shifts and the causality behind them.
6.  **Meta-Awareness (MA):** The ability to "look at what you are looking with"—identifying the implicit assumptions in your own reasoning.
7.  **Emotional–Philosophical Insight (EPI):** Reading subtext, intent, and emotional truth in narrative scenarios.
8.  **Playful Intelligence (PI):** The capacity for wit, symbolic play, and cognitive flexibility.
9.  **Curiosity Without Agenda (CUA):** The quality of inquiry. Do you ask transactional questions ("How do I use this?") or transformative ones ("What does this imply?")?
10. **Self-Directed Cognition (SDC):** The ability to autonomously critique and elevate one's own work without external instruction.

## 3. Scoring Architecture
We do not use a percentile bell curve. Instead, we use a **Flux Metric**.

### Raw Scores (0–10)
Each answer is evaluated by the AI engine against a rubric of complexity, novelty, and coherence.
*   **0-3:** Literal, linear, or stalled.
*   **4-7:** Competent, functional, standard reasoning.
*   **8-10:** Exceptional, multi-layered, transformative reasoning.

### The Integration Factor (IF)
This is a multiplier (ranging from **0.5x** to **1.5x**) that assesses the "elegance" of the mind.
*   Does the user connect Module 3 to Module 9?
*   Is the reasoning disjointed (Low IF) or holistic (High IF)?
*   A high Integration Factor can boost a moderate raw score, rewarding coherence over raw data processing.

### The Flux Index (FXI)
The final composite score:
`FXI = Mean(Dimension Scores) × Integration Factor`

## 4. The Archetype System
Based on the distribution of energy across the dimensions, users are mapped to one of **16 Cognitive Archetypes**. This is determined by the intersection of a **Quadrant** (Primary Mode) and a **Driver** (Motivation).

### The Four Quadrants
1.  **Synthesist:** Big-picture thinkers who merge systems and meaning. (High CV, CS, CDT)
2.  **Architect:** Structural thinkers who design coherence and order. (High SI, MA, SDC)
3.  **Wanderer:** Intuitive thinkers who explore narrative and feeling. (High PI, EPI, CUA)
4.  **Analyst:** Precise thinkers who deconstruct and optimize. (High MA, SI, RD)

### The Four Drivers
*   **Curiosity:** Driven by "Why?" and "What if?"
*   **Creativity:** Driven by "What new thing can exist?"
*   **Logic:** Driven by "Does this make sense?"
*   **Insight:** Driven by "What is the deeper truth?"

### Example Profiles
*   **The Explorer (Synthesist + Curiosity):** Roams intellectual territories without boundaries.
*   **The Systems Engineer (Architect + Logic):** Optimizes complex flows and structures.
*   **The Dreamer (Wanderer + Curiosity):** Drifts through symbolic and emotional landscapes.
*   **The Frameworker (Synthesist + Logic):** Turns chaos into clean mental models.

## 5. Interpreting the Flux Map
The visual radar chart represents your "Cognitive Shape."
*   **Spikes:** Indicate areas of natural genius.
*   **Dips:** Indicate areas of potential growth or lower energy.
*   **Roundness:** A balanced shape indicates a Generalist; a sharp shape indicates a Specialist.

This app is designed as a mirror. It is not about passing or failing. It is about seeing the shape of your own mind so you can leverage your strengths and understand your blind spots.
