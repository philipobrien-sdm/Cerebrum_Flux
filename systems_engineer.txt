Module 1: Creative Velocity Test
Prompt: "Generate 20 unique uses for a brick made entirely of ice in 2 minutes."
Response:
1. Thermal buffer
2. Phase-change study block
3. Load-testing surrogate
4. Low-temperature calibration mass
5. Melt-rate predictor
6. Cold-signal reflector
7. Insulation gap test
8. Ice-compression block
9. Water distribution control node
10. Temporary structural element
11. Failure test sample
12. Hydraulic learning block
13. Thermal differential tester
14. Environmental stress marker
15. Short-term coolant
16. Material-testing cube
17. Force-distribution demonstrator
18. Melt-flow indicator
19. Snow wall interlock
20. Cold-state mechanical dummy

Module 2: Systems Intuition Task
Prompt: "Consider a beehive system with four components: The Queen (A), Workers (B), Drones (C), and Larvae (D). Predict the complex behavioral shifts in the system if the Workers (B) suddenly stop foraging and stay in the hive."
Response:
Workers ceasing foraging eliminates the input channel. Larvae rationing begins, drones lose purpose, queen’s pheromones rise but fail to correct missing flow. System enters degraded mode; thermal instability and brood failure cascade.

Module 3: Cross-Domain Transfer Task
Prompt: "Explain the concept of 'Inflation' in economics using only metaphors related to baking bread."
Response:
Inflation is bread dough with excess gas relative to structural capacity — volume increases, but mechanical integrity decreases.

Module 4: Conceptual Synthesis Task
Prompt: "Merge the philosophy of 'Existentialism' with the mechanics of 'Aerodynamics'. Create a new concept from their union."
Response:
Existential Load Dynamics: Meaning behaves like lift-to-drag ratio. Purpose emerges from optimising the vector between internal drive and external constraint.

Module 5: Reflective Depth Assessment
Prompt: "What is one deeply held belief you held 5 years ago that you have since discarded? Explain specifically what dismantled it."
Response:
I believed precision prevented mistakes. But experience proved mistakes generate the data precision relies on.

Module 6: Meta-Awareness Challenge
Prompt: "Analyze your answer to the previous question (Module 5). What unstated assumption does your reasoning rely on?"
Response:
Assumption: That error-free operation is optimal; ignoring that iteration is necessary.

Module 7: Emotional–Philosophical Insight Probe
Prompt: "Read this vignette: 'A man stands at the departure gate of an airport, watching a plane take off. He has a ticket in his pocket for that flight, but he is smiling.' Describe the emotional truth of this situation."
Response:
He smiles because his choice recalibrates his life — the flight was misaligned with his internal vector.

Module 8: Playful Intelligence Test
Prompt: "Tell me a joke, write a riddle, or create a metaphor that perfectly captures your current state of mind right now."
Response:
“I’m a machine learning model waiting for better training data.”

Module 9: Curiosity Without Agenda Test
Prompt: "I am placing 5 objects on a table: A rusted key, a silicon wafer, a dried rose petal, a heavy lead coin, and a glass vial of sand. List 3 questions you would want to ask to understand the relationship between them."
Response:
1. What system links organic decay and engineered materials?
2. How do their physical properties interact over time?
3. Which ordering reveals a hidden process?

Module 10: Self-Directed Cognition Task
Prompt: "Review your performance in this session. Choose one previous answer you gave that you are dissatisfied with. Rewrite it now to make it more elegant, without being told how."
Response:
Revision: Optimisation metaphor improved: Meaning = alignment between chosen trajectory and available energy.
