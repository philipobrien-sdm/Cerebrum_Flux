6. Conceptual scaffolding prop
7. Temporary semiotic object
8. Idea incubation crystal
9. Transience representation
10. Cold-themed thought experiment
11. Layered meaning block
12. Paradox demonstration tool
13. Freeze–thaw dialectic model
14. Ice-based allegory
15. Reflective surface for symbolism
16. Sensory abstraction cube
17. Temporality metaphor
18. Concept pipeline seed
19. Ephemeral ontology sample
20. Embodied analogy object

Module 2: Systems Intuition Task
Prompt: "Consider a beehive system with four components: The Queen (A), Workers (B), Drones (C), and Larvae (D). Predict the complex behavioral shifts in the system if the Workers (B) suddenly stop foraging and stay in the hive."
Response:
Worker halt → system loses external grounding → pantry becomes a metaphor for insufficient epistemic resources → queen attempts to maintain coherence → drones become redundant signifiers → larvae become unfulfilled potential.

Module 3: Cross-Domain Transfer Task
Prompt: "Explain the concept of 'Inflation' in economics using only metaphors related to baking bread."
Response:
Inflation is bread dough whose metaphorical “meaning density” dilutes — more shape, less substance; greater volume, weaker truth.

Module 4: Conceptual Synthesis Task
Prompt: "Merge the philosophy of 'Existentialism' with the mechanics of 'Aerodynamics'. Create a new concept from their union."
Response:
Existential Lift Theory: Aerodynamics teaches that shape meets wind; existentialism teaches that choice meets chaos. Combine them: identity is the wing, and authenticity the angle of attack.

Module 5: Reflective Depth Assessment
Prompt: "What is one deeply held belief you held 5 years ago that you have since discarded? Explain specifically what dismantled it."
Response:
I used to believe contradictions were errors. Now I see they are doorways to deeper concepts.

Module 6: Meta-Awareness Challenge
Prompt: "Analyze your answer to the previous question (Module 5). What unstated assumption does your reasoning rely on?"
Response:
Assumption: That coherence is inherently superior to paradox.

Module 7: Emotional–Philosophical Insight Probe
Prompt: "Read this vignette: 'A man stands at the departure gate of an airport, watching a plane take off. He has a ticket in his pocket for that flight, but he is smiling.' Describe the emotional truth of this situation."
Response:
He smiles because he realised the departure narrative no longer fits the conceptual story of his life.

Module 8: Playful Intelligence Test
Prompt: "Tell me a joke, write a riddle, or create a metaphor that perfectly captures your current state of mind right now."
Response:
“My mind is a thesaurus chasing butterflies.”

Module 9: Curiosity Without Agenda Test
Prompt: "I am placing 5 objects on a table: A rusted key, a silicon wafer, a dried rose petal, a heavy lead coin, and a glass vial of sand. List 3 questions you would want to ask to understand the relationship between them."
Response:
1. Do these items share a thematic resonance?
2. Which archetype does each correspond to?
3. What conceptual framework unites them?

Module 10: Self-Directed Cognition Task
Prompt: "Review your performance in this session. Choose one previous answer you gave that you are dissatisfied with. Rewrite it now to make it more elegant, without being told how."
Response:
Revision: Paradox isn’t noise — it’s the friction that generates conceptual lift.
