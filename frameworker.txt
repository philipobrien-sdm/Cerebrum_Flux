15. Melt-driven timer
16. Snow compression block
17. Blueprint model

Module 2: Systems Intuition Task
Prompt: "Consider a beehive system with four components: The Queen (A), Workers (B), Drones (C), and Larvae (D). Predict the complex behavioral shifts in the system if the Workers (B) suddenly stop foraging and stay in the hive."
Response:
Worker halt → system loses intake flow → queen’s output unaffected → drones idle → larvae rationing begins → hive thermodynamic imbalance → eventual role reallocation from house bees → internal survival mode.

Module 3: Cross-Domain Transfer Task
Prompt: "Explain the concept of 'Inflation' in economics using only metaphors related to baking bread."
Response:
Inflation is dough expanding because gas accumulates faster than gluten strengthens — structure can’t keep pace with expansion.

Module 4: Conceptual Synthesis Task
Prompt: "Merge the philosophy of 'Existentialism' with the mechanics of 'Aerodynamics'. Create a new concept from their union."
Response:
Existential Aerodynamic Model: Meaning = Lift Coefficient × Choice Velocity × Angle of Authenticity.

Module 5: Reflective Depth Assessment
Prompt: "What is one deeply held belief you held 5 years ago that you have since discarded? Explain specifically what dismantled it."
Response:
I believed productivity equaled worth. Burnout showed me worth exists independently of output.

Module 6: Meta-Awareness Challenge
Prompt: "Analyze your answer to the previous question (Module 5). What unstated assumption does your reasoning rely on?"
Response:
Assumption: That personal value is quantifiable.

Module 7: Emotional–Philosophical Insight Probe
Prompt: "Read this vignette: 'A man stands at the departure gate of an airport, watching a plane take off. He has a ticket in his pocket for that flight, but he is smiling.' Describe the emotional truth of this situation."
Response:
His smile reflects internal alignment: departure is optional, not compulsory.

Module 8: Playful Intelligence Test
Prompt: "Tell me a joke, write a riddle, or create a metaphor that perfectly captures your current state of mind right now."
Response:
“I’m a spreadsheet trying to relax.”

Module 9: Curiosity Without Agenda Test
Prompt: "I am placing 5 objects on a table: A rusted key, a silicon wafer, a dried rose petal, a heavy lead coin, and a glass vial of sand. List 3 questions you would want to ask to understand the relationship between them."
Response:
1. What system links mechanical, biological, and symbolic degradation?
2. Are these artefacts arranged intentionally?
3. What classification scheme would group them?

Module 10: Self-Directed Cognition Task
Prompt: "Review your performance in this session. Choose one previous answer you gave that you are dissatisfied with. Rewrite it now to make it more elegant, without being told how."
Response:
Revision: Meaning emerges when the angle between self-concept and action is minimal — reducing existential drag.
