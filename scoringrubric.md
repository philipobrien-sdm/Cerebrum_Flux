# Universal Scoring Rubric (10 Dimensions)

Each dimension is scored 0–10.
Scores represent how strongly a participant expresses the cognitive style the module probes.

## 1. Creative Velocity
How rapidly the mind generates diverse, non-linear ideas under constraint.

**High (8–10):**
- 15 unique ideas, no category repetition
- Uses metaphor, inversion, absurdity
- Demonstrates speed + originality simultaneously

**Mid (4–7):**
- 8–14 ideas
- Mix of literal and creative uses
- Some conceptual leap, but uneven

**Low (0–3):**
- <8 ideas
- Highly literal
- Repeats categories or stalls

**Measured:** Divergent thinking bandwidth.

## 2. Systems Intuition
Ability to simulate cascading interactions in dynamic systems.

**High:**
- Multi-level chain reactions
- Predicts feedback loops, role reassignments
- Holistic + mechanistic understanding

**Mid:**
- Linear cause/effect
- Limited secondary implications

**Low:**
- Only surface-level effects
- No second-order reasoning

**Measured:** Systems theory awareness.

## 3. Cross-Domain Transfer
Ability to translate a concept into a different metaphorical or structural domain.

**High:**
- Precise mapping
- Structural equivalence maintained
- Interpretation reveals hidden parallels

**Mid:**
- Partial mapping
- Mostly decorative metaphor

**Low:**
- No actual mapping
- Re-stating the concept using generic words

**Measured:** Analogical reasoning.

## 4. Conceptual Synthesis
Ability to merge unrelated domains into a coherent new concept.

**High:**
- A genuinely novel, stable theoretical construct
- Internal logic holds
- Demonstrates philosophical or scientific cohesion

**Mid:**
- Interesting but loose connections
- Concept feels fragile

**Low:**
- Simply juxtaposes two ideas
- No integration

**Measured:** Higher-order abstraction.

## 5. Reflective Depth
Ability to analyze one’s past cognitive frameworks and explain their transformation.

**High:**
- Identifies belief + causal dismantling + internal process
- Incorporates emotion + cognition + context

**Mid:**
- Belief described but reasoning vague
- Partially reflective

**Low:**
- Belief stated without explanation
- Surface-level “I changed my mind”

**Measured:** Self-reflective intelligence.

## 6. Meta-Awareness
Ability to identify implicit assumptions underlying one’s own reasoning.

**High:**
- Names precise hidden premise
- Shows awareness of cognitive bias
- Demonstrates second-order thought

**Mid:**
- Vague or partial assumption
- Overly broad statements

**Low:**
- No real assumption identified
- Restates Module 5 answer

**Measured:** Introspective recursion.

## 7. Emotional–Philosophical Insight
Ability to detect emotional truth beneath narrative or behaviour.

**High:**
- Identifies subtext
- Balances emotion + cognition
- Connects action to internal landscape

**Mid:**
- Generic emotional reading
- Some insight, but not deep

**Low:**
- Literal interpretation
- No emotional inference

**Measured:** Interpretive acuity.

## 8. Playful Intelligence
Capacity for symbolic play, humour, and associative creativity.

**High:**
- Quick symbolic twist
- Witty, metaphoric, inventive
- Reveals surprising cognitive flexibility

**Mid:**
- Mild creativity
- Safe humour or simple riddle

**Low:**
- Literal joke or cliché
- No symbolic shift

**Measured:** Cognitive spontaneity.

## 9. Curiosity Without Agenda
Quality of open-ended questions that seek understanding, not utility.

**High:**
- Exploratory, evocative questions
- Not solution-oriented
- Demonstrates appreciation of mystery

**Mid:**
- Practical curiosity
- “How does it work?” rather than “What does it mean?”

**Low:**
- Transactional questions
- Attempts to solve instead of explore

**Measured:** Uninstrumental curiosity.

## 10. Self-Directed Cognition
Ability to refine and elevate one’s own output without instruction.

**High:**
- Self-critiquing + elegant reframing
- Improves structure, clarity, tone
- Shows autonomy

**Mid:**
- Minor edits
- Clarifies but doesn’t transform

**Low:**
- Cosmetic rewrite
- No real improvement

**Measured:** Autonomous revision capability.
