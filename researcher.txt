1. Cold-sterile sample press
2. Ice core micro-section
3. Temporary Petri dish
4. Phase-change control sample
5. Melt-rate calibration tool
6. Water purity test block
7. Freezer sensor stress test
8. Light diffusion study cube
9. Ice fractal documentation aid
10. Density measurement anchor
11. Cold-material comparison sample
12. Evaporation rate marker
13. Ice surface for microscopy
14. Controlled-drip timing unit
15. Chemistry reaction inhibitor
16. Frost behaviour recorder
17. Surface tension visualizer
18. Melt-channel observation
19. Ice acoustic tester
20. Temporary material placeholder

Module 2: Systems Intuition Task
Prompt: "Consider a beehive system with four components: The Queen (A), Workers (B), Drones (C), and Larvae (D). Predict the complex behavioral shifts in the system if the Workers (B) suddenly stop foraging and stay in the hive."
Response:
Workers stop foraging → food supply becomes fixed → larvae enter nutrient deficit → drones maintain reproductive function but no net value → queen increases pheromone output → hive temperature shifts, destabilising metabolic load → colony survival probability plummets.

Module 3: Cross-Domain Transfer Task
Prompt: "Explain the concept of 'Inflation' in economics using only metaphors related to baking bread."
Response:
Inflation is dough accumulating gas molecules faster than the gluten network can bind them — expansion exceeding structural capacity.

Module 4: Conceptual Synthesis Task
Prompt: "Merge the philosophy of 'Existentialism' with the mechanics of 'Aerodynamics'. Create a new concept from their union."
Response:
Existential Aerodynamic Model 2.0: Meaning = f(Choice × Velocity × Resistance). Lift emerges when intentional action meets structured constraint.

Module 5: Reflective Depth Assessment
Prompt: "What is one deeply held belief you held 5 years ago that you have since discarded? Explain specifically what dismantled it."
Response:
I used to believe truth was objective and static. Longitudinal studies showed truth is often contextual and probabilistic.

Module 6: Meta-Awareness Challenge
Prompt: "Analyze your answer to the previous question (Module 5). What unstated assumption does your reasoning rely on?"
Response:
Assumption: That empirical evidence always maps directly onto lived experience.

Module 7: Emotional–Philosophical Insight Probe
Prompt: "Read this vignette: 'A man stands at the departure gate of an airport, watching a plane take off. He has a ticket in his pocket for that flight, but he is smiling.' Describe the emotional truth of this situation."
Response:
He smiles because he made a controlled decision: staying aligns better with his internal cost–benefit matrix than boarding.

Module 8: Playful Intelligence Test
Prompt: "Tell me a joke, write a riddle, or create a metaphor that perfectly captures your current state of mind right now."
Response:
“My mind is a laboratory where the beakers occasionally flirt.”

Module 9: Curiosity Without Agenda Test
Prompt: "I am placing 5 objects on a table: A rusted key, a silicon wafer, a dried rose petal, a heavy lead coin, and a glass vial of sand. List 3 questions you would want to ask to understand the relationship between them."
Response:
1. What variables link these items (composition, age, environment)?
2. Are their decay rates comparable?
3. Could they be artifacts from sequential experiments?

Module 10: Self-Directed Cognition Task
Prompt: "Review your performance in this session. Choose one previous answer you gave that you are dissatisfied with. Rewrite it now to make it more elegant, without being told how."
Response:
Revision: More rigorous model: Meaning arises from optimally aligning internal values with external constraints, not merely from resistance.
