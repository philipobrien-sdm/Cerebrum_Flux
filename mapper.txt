Module 1: Creative Velocity Test
Prompt: "Generate 20 unique uses for a brick made entirely of ice in 2 minutes."
Response:
1. Melt-sequencing marker
2. Temporary boundary marker
3. Water-distribution grid tile
4. Temperature milestone stone
5. Pathfinding token in snow
6. Ice compass base
7. Melt-route experiment block
8. Cold-region teaching prop
9. Hydration waypoint indicator
10. Thermal mapping sample
11. Short-lived signpost
12. Resource map anchor
13. Field-grid calibration marker
14. Exploratory breadcrumb
15. Temporary coordinate node
16. Wildlife tracking lure
17. Ice topography model
18. Short-use trail marker
19. Weathering reference block
20. Spatial measurement reference

Module 2: Systems Intuition Task
Prompt: "Consider a beehive system with four components: The Queen (A), Workers (B), Drones (C), and Larvae (D). Predict the complex behavioral shifts in the system if the Workers (B) suddenly stop foraging and stay in the hive."
Response:
If workers stop foraging: The hive’s intake node collapses. The queen's signal intensity rises, drones remain idle, larvae enter starvation triage, and workers shift roles inward. The system reorganises into survival mode: stability replaces expansion.

Module 3: Cross-Domain Transfer Task
Prompt: "Explain the concept of 'Inflation' in economics using only metaphors related to baking bread."
Response:
Inflation is like dough inflated with too much warm air: it expands beyond the structural grid the gluten provides. The “map” of bread stretches, but its density and substance diminish.

Module 4: Conceptual Synthesis Task
Prompt: "Merge the philosophy of 'Existentialism' with the mechanics of 'Aerodynamics'. Create a new concept from their union."
Response:
Existential Aeromap: Meaning is navigation: airflow is uncertainty, and the self must constantly adjust direction. Lift is achieved by mapping resistance into orientation.

Module 5: Reflective Depth Assessment
Prompt: "What is one deeply held belief you held 5 years ago that you have since discarded? Explain specifically what dismantled it."
Response:
I believed life required clear long-term planning. Eventually I realised maps are approximations — and reality demands flexible navigation.

Module 6: Meta-Awareness Challenge
Prompt: "Analyze your answer to the previous question (Module 5). What unstated assumption does your reasoning rely on?"
Response:
I assumed predictability is possible and preferable — which itself is an illusion we use to avoid uncertainty.

Module 7: Emotional–Philosophical Insight Probe
Prompt: "Read this vignette: 'A man stands at the departure gate of an airport, watching a plane take off. He has a ticket in his pocket for that flight, but he is smiling.' Describe the emotional truth of this situation."
Response:
He smiles because he has chosen a different path. The ticket is a map he no longer wants to follow.

Module 8: Playful Intelligence Test
Prompt: "Tell me a joke, write a riddle, or create a metaphor that perfectly captures your current state of mind right now."
Response:
“My mind is a compass that keeps discovering new norths.”

Module 9: Curiosity Without Agenda Test
Prompt: "I am placing 5 objects on a table: A rusted key, a silicon wafer, a dried rose petal, a heavy lead coin, and a glass vial of sand. List 3 questions you would want to ask to understand the relationship between them."
Response:
1. Is there a pattern to their materials?
2. Do they map a timeline of decay?
3. Are they connected through human intention or accident?

Module 10: Self-Directed Cognition Task
Prompt: "Review your performance in this session. Choose one previous answer you gave that you are dissatisfied with. Rewrite it now to make it more elegant, without being told how."
Response:
Revision: A clearer synthesis: Life’s map is always redrawn; meaning is an update, not a destination.
