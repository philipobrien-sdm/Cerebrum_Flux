1. Ice sculpture module
2. Cold architectural tile
3. Reflective light panel
4. Temporary garden divider
5. Airflow diffuser
6. Ice lantern mould
7. Melt-based kinetics model
8. Temperature-responsive décor
9. Minimalist aesthetic block
10. Space-design accent
11. Textured imprint tool
12. Snow-wall joint
13. Cold sculpture foundation
14. Silent door bumper
15. Minimalist desk ornament
16. Ice typography block
17. Temporary signage frame
18. Relief carving platform
19. Melt-pattern art source
20. Light-scattering surface

Module 2: Systems Intuition Task
Prompt: "Consider a beehive system with four components: The Queen (A), Workers (B), Drones (C), and Larvae (D). Predict the complex behavioral shifts in the system if the Workers (B) suddenly stop foraging and stay in the hive."
Response:
Worker stoppage collapses the hive’s design proportions. The temperature increases, resource inputs drop, and interior roles shift. The hive’s balance tilts toward internal maintenance, abandoning expansion.

Module 3: Cross-Domain Transfer Task
Prompt: "Explain the concept of 'Inflation' in economics using only metaphors related to baking bread."
Response:
Inflation is dough expanding unevenly — air pockets grow faster than the dough’s structure can support, warping the design.

Module 4: Conceptual Synthesis Task
Prompt: "Merge the philosophy of 'Existentialism' with the mechanics of 'Aerodynamics'. Create a new concept from their union."
Response:
Existential Aesthetic Flow: Life’s meaning emerges from how we shape our motion through resistance. Aerodynamics shows that form determines trajectory; existentialism shows that choice determines form.

Module 5: Reflective Depth Assessment
Prompt: "What is one deeply held belief you held 5 years ago that you have since discarded? Explain specifically what dismantled it."
Response:
I used to believe beauty required symmetry. Then I realised asymmetry holds more honesty — design reflects life, not perfection.

Module 6: Meta-Awareness Challenge
Prompt: "Analyze your answer to the previous question (Module 5). What unstated assumption does your reasoning rely on?"
Response:
I assumed balance equals harmony, ignoring that irregularity creates character.

Module 7: Emotional–Philosophical Insight Probe
Prompt: "Read this vignette: 'A man stands at the departure gate of an airport, watching a plane take off. He has a ticket in his pocket for that flight, but he is smiling.' Describe the emotional truth of this situation."
Response:
He smiles because the design of his life has shifted — that flight no longer fits the architecture he wants to inhabit.

Module 8: Playful Intelligence Test
Prompt: "Tell me a joke, write a riddle, or create a metaphor that perfectly captures your current state of mind right now."
Response:
“My mind is a blueprint doodling on itself.”

Module 9: Curiosity Without Agenda Test
Prompt: "I am placing 5 objects on a table: A rusted key, a silicon wafer, a dried rose petal, a heavy lead coin, and a glass vial of sand. List 3 questions you would want to ask to understand the relationship between them."
Response:
1. What design principle links these forms?
2. Which object disrupts the pattern?
3. How has time reshaped each surface?

Module 10: Self-Directed Cognition Task
Prompt: "Review your performance in this session. Choose one previous answer you gave that you are dissatisfied with. Rewrite it now to make it more elegant, without being told how."
Response:
Revision: Aesthetic truth: Meaning isn’t discovered — it’s crafted by shaping resistance elegantly.
