Module 2: Systems Intuition Task
Prompt: "Consider a beehive system with four components: The Queen (A), Workers (B), Drones (C), and Larvae (D). Predict the complex behavioral shifts in the system if the Workers (B) suddenly stop foraging and stay in the hive."
Response:
Workers stop → hive enters interpretive crisis. Queen signals urgency but cannot translate function into action. Drones become symbolic rather than useful. Larvae embody unrealised futures.

Module 3: Cross-Domain Transfer Task
Prompt: "Explain the concept of 'Inflation' in economics using only metaphors related to baking bread."
Response:
Inflation is bread whose rising exaggerates its promise — abundance that feels increasingly hollow.

Module 4: Conceptual Synthesis Task
Prompt: "Merge the philosophy of 'Existentialism' with the mechanics of 'Aerodynamics'. Create a new concept from their union."
Response:
Aero-Interpretive Existentialism: Meaning is reading the wind while resisting its push — interpretation as navigation through invisible forces.

Module 5: Reflective Depth Assessment
Prompt: "What is one deeply held belief you held 5 years ago that you have since discarded? Explain specifically what dismantled it."
Response:
I believed emotions should be explained, not experienced. Then I learned that explanation without experience is avoidance.

Response:
Assumption: That emotional distance equals clarity.

Module 7: Emotional–Philosophical Insight Probe
Prompt: "Read this vignette: 'A man stands at the departure gate of an airport, watching a plane take off. He has a ticket in his pocket for that flight, but he is smiling.' Describe the emotional truth of this situation."
Response:
He smiles because staying is an honest conversation with himself — one he avoided for years.

Module 8: Playful Intelligence Test
Prompt: "Tell me a joke, write a riddle, or create a metaphor that perfectly captures your current state of mind right now."
Response:
“My mind is a decoder ring dipped in sentiment.”

Module 9: Curiosity Without Agenda Test
Prompt: "I am placing 5 objects on a table: A rusted key, a silicon wafer, a dried rose petal, a heavy lead coin, and a glass vial of sand. List 3 questions you would want to ask to understand the relationship between them."
Response:
1. What emotional residue do these objects hold?
2. How does each object alter the narrative?
3. Which one is carrying the heaviest silence?

Module 10: Self-Directed Cognition Task
Prompt: "Review your performance in this session. Choose one previous answer you gave that you are dissatisfied with. Rewrite it now to make it more elegant, without being told how."
Response:
Revision: Emotional clarity is not analysis — it is allowed presence.
