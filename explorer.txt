Module 2: Systems Intuition Task
Prompt: "Consider a beehive system with four components: The Queen (A), Workers (B), Drones (C), and Larvae (D). Predict the complex behavioral shifts in the system if the Workers (B) suddenly stop foraging and stay in the hive."
Response:
Workers stop foraging → food shortage → queen’s pheromone pattern shifts → drones decrease mating flights → larvae receive less royal jelly → hive becomes heat-rich but resource-poor → behavioural agitation → premature queen cup construction → potential swarm collapse.

Module 3: Cross-Domain Transfer Task
Prompt: "Explain the concept of 'Inflation' in economics using only metaphors related to baking bread."
Response:
Inflation is like bread dough over-proofing: the air pockets (money supply) expand faster than the structure (goods/services), so everything looks bigger, but nothing is sturdier — and eventually it collapses if not baked in time.

Module 4: Conceptual Synthesis Task
Prompt: "Merge the philosophy of 'Existentialism' with the mechanics of 'Aerodynamics'. Create a new concept from their union."
Response:
Existential Aerodynamics: The self is a lifting body, generating meaning the same way wings generate lift — not by seeking a “correct” angle, but by shaping resistance into upward motion.

Module 5: Reflective Depth Assessment
Prompt: "What is one deeply held belief you held 5 years ago that you have since discarded? Explain specifically what dismantled it."
Response:
I used to believe hard work always led to good outcomes. Watching randomness shape people’s lives dismantled that — it wasn’t effort that determined outcomes, but context, chance, and compassion.

Module 6: Meta-Awareness Challenge
Prompt: "Analyze your answer to the previous question (Module 5). What unstated assumption does your reasoning rely on?"
Response:
My reasoning assumed that fairness was the default expectation, so losing that belief felt like a “shift,” when in reality fairness was never guaranteed.

Module 7: Emotional–Philosophical Insight Probe
Prompt: "Read this vignette: 'A man stands at the departure gate of an airport, watching a plane take off. He has a ticket in his pocket for that flight, but he is smiling.' Describe the emotional truth of this situation."
Response:
He smiles because he’s choosing not to leave. The meaning isn’t in the destination he skipped — it’s in recognising that staying is no longer an act of fear.

Module 8: Playful Intelligence Test
Prompt: "Tell me a joke, write a riddle, or create a metaphor that perfectly captures your current state of mind right now."
Response:
“My mind is a snow globe someone keeps gently shaking.”

Module 9: Curiosity Without Agenda Test
Prompt: "I am placing 5 objects on a table: A rusted key, a silicon wafer, a dried rose petal, a heavy lead coin, and a glass vial of sand. List 3 questions you would want to ask to understand the relationship between them."
Response:
1. Which object was found last?
2. Do any share a history of decay or transformation?
3. Are these artefacts from one person’s life or many?

Module 10: Self-Directed Cognition Task
Prompt: "Review your performance in this session. Choose one previous answer you gave that you are dissatisfied with. Rewrite it now to make it more elegant, without being told how."
Response:
Revision: Original existential aerodynamics analogy was poetic but vague.
Improved: Meaning is generated the same way lift arises — through the deliberate shaping of one’s interaction with resistance. Neither exists without friction.
