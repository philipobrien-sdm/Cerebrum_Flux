# MBTI ↔ Cerebrum Flux Archetype Correlation Map

This correlation isn’t rigid — it reflects cognitive style, not personality.
Still, it’s surprisingly predictive.

## SYNTHESIST QUADRANT
Big-picture, cross-domain, systems + meaning.

1. Explorer → ENFP / INFP
Curiosity + meaning + fluid idea generation.

2. Innovator → ENTP
Creative combustion + systemic play + novelty seeking.

3. Frameworker → INTJ
Structural abstraction + long-term conceptual architecture.

4. Philosopher-Engineer → INFJ
Symbolic reasoning + deep introspective structure.

## ARCHITECT QUADRANT
Structure, design, mapping, coherence.

5. Mapper → ENTP / ENFP hybrid
Cartographer mind — relational patterns + exploration.

6. Designer → ISFP / INFP
Aesthetic reasoning + symbolic shape + emotive design.

7. Systems Engineer → ISTJ / INTJ

9. Dreamer → INFP
Symbolic imagination, drifting creativity.

10. Artist-Inventor → ENFP / ESFP
Expressive, spontaneous, playful.

11. Pattern Forager → INTJ / ISTP
Pattern-seeking + sensory observation.

12. Inner Voyager → INFJ / INFP
