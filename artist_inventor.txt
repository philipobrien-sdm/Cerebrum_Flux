Module 2: Systems Intuition Task
Prompt: "Consider a beehive system with four components: The Queen (A), Workers (B), Drones (C), and Larvae (D). Predict the complex behavioral shifts in the system if the Workers (B) suddenly stop foraging and stay in the hive."

When workers stop, the hive becomes a badly tuned orchestra: drones hum without purpose, larvae cry off-key hunger notes, and the queen conducts silence instead of song.

Module 3: Cross-Domain Transfer Task
Prompt: "Explain the concept of 'Inflation' in economics using only metaphors related to baking bread."

Prompt: "Merge the philosophy of 'Existentialism' with the mechanics of 'Aerodynamics'. Create a new concept from their union."

Response:
I believed art needed to impress others. Now I create to breathe, not to be applauded.

Module 7: Emotional–Philosophical Insight Probe
Prompt: "Read this vignette: 'A man stands at the departure gate of an airport, watching a plane take off. He has a ticket in his pocket for that flight, but he is smiling.' Describe the emotional truth of this situation."

“I’m a paintbrush dipped in caffeine.”

Response:
1. What emotional palette do these objects share?
2. Could they be props from a forgotten play?
3. Which object changes the story if removed?

Module 10: Self-Directed Cognition Task
Prompt: "Review your performance in this session. Choose one previous answer you gave that you are dissatisfied with. Rewrite it now to make it more elegant, without being told how."
Response:
Revision: Art isn’t performed for the wind—it moves with it.
